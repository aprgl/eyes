# Procedure
1. Laser cut (or ask a friend, or oder on pololu or similar) backstop.svg. This is the 
2. Cutout a black (or whatever color preference) sticker using a vinyl cutter and the sticker.svg file, or sisors with a 2.5in OD and 1.28in ID
3. Apply the sticker to the laser cut backstop concentric to the outer edge
4. Place the dispaly in the backstop using the sticker to lock it in place
5. _Test the display to make sure it works before moving on_
6. Clean the silicone molds, **use a lint free cloth**
7. Mix and degass epoxy
8. Fill the half sphere cake mold with epoxy and genly place the display in the epoxy on the back surface being careful to start at one side and genly lower against the face. You're trying to minimze bubbles at this stage, think about how you would apply a sticker. Another option to try is to pre-wet the display with epoxy as well before placing against the back surface of the mold.
